#### About us

To date, the scale up of economic inclusion programs builds on a [promising evidence base](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/34917). However, there are still critical gaps in understanding the mechanisms and drivers of impact and cost-effectiveness especially for large-scale government-led programs. The World Bank's [Partnership for Economic Inclusion](https://www.peiglobal.org/sites/pei/files/2020-10/pei%20annual%20report%202020-HR.pdf) (PEI) and [Development Impact Evaluation department](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime) (DIME) have partnered to launch the *Impact Evaluation Collaborative on Moving Economic Inclusion to Scale* (PEI IE Collaborative) with the goal of informing an evidence-based scale-up of economic inclusion programming through the implementation of high quality impact evaluations and assessment of cost-effectiveness of government-led economic inclusion programs. 

#### This dashboard

This dashboard summarizes planned and ongoing impact evaluations studies related to economic inclusion programs, and how they map to the PEI IE Collaborative's priority evidence gaps to inform the scaling-up of economic inclusion programs. The objective of this dashboard is to allow the PEI IE Collaborative and its technical partners to identify sources of potential future evidence, and thus bridge the knowledge gap between published results/evidence and ongoing/planned rigorous studies. Thus, it supports the production of knowledge public goods and tools based on ongoing and completed evaluations, which is one of the Collaborative's goals.
